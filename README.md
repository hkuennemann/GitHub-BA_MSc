# GitHub Repository for MSc Business Analytics program
This repository contains the projects that I completed during my MSc Business Analytics program. It includes the coding work for the coding-intensive courses I took during my master's program.

## Courses and Projects

Below is a list of the courses, each represented in different folders within this repository:

### Advanced Data Analytics
- **Folder:** `Advanced Data Analytics`
- **Description:** The course focused on advanced data analysis techniques and their applications in machine learning. It began with programming for data analysis, progressed through distributed data analysis and SQL, and covered key concepts such as curve fitting and regression. Students delved into modeling dynamic systems, dimensionality reduction, classification, clustering, and distributed machine learning, equipping students with a broad array of techniques for handling various types of data. Finally, it introduced graph algorithms and cloud-based data analysis, highlighting modern approaches to managing and analyzing large datasets.
- **Projects:**
  - Project 1: Brief description of project 1
  - Project 2: Brief description of project 2
  - Project 2: Brief description of project 3
  - Project 4: Brief description of project 4

### Data Curation
- **Folder:** `Data Curation`
- **Description:** This course introduced concepts of data curation and management with applications. Students explored data characteristics and performed data curation through hands-on experiences, such as data extraction, data wrangling, data exploration, and database, and data science workflow in terms of reproducible Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes.

  - Project 6: Brief description of project 6


### Data Visualization
- **Folder:** `Data Visualization`
- **Description:** This course taught the art and science of converting data into graphical representations, making complex information easily understandable. It covered key principles of human perception in interpreting visual information, highlighting how visual variables like color, size, and shape can convey different aspects of data. The course delved into various techniques for visualizing multivariate data, including point-based, line-based, and region-based methods, ensuring students understand how to choose the right technique for different data types. Additionally, it dealt as an introduction course for Tableau, equipping students with practical skills in creating effective and insightful visualizations.
